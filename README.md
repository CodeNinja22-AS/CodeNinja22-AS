# Hi, I’m Abhrant Singh 👋

Cybersecurity Engineer | Cloud & AI-Security Focus  
Building resilient, intelligent security systems for real-world infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 Profile

I work at the intersection of **cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and intelligent automation**, focusing on how real-world systems fail and how they can be designed to remain resilient under pressure.

My approach is rooted in **defensive security and systems thinking** — understanding attacker behavior, infrastructure constraints, and the trade-offs involved in securing complex, distributed environments.

I am particularly interested in applying **automation and AI-assisted techniques** to security operations, log analysis, and threat detection, with an emphasis on building solutions that scale reliably rather than relying on manual intervention.

> Currently developing depth across security engineering, cloud security fundamentals, and applied research-oriented projects.
